# Full Stack Developer Nanodegree Projects
These are my project submissions to Udacity's FSND program.

## [Project 1: Designing a Venue Booking Database](https://github.com/mahri-a/Full-Stack-Developer-Nanodegree/tree/main/01_fyyur)

I built out the data models and database for a musical venue and artist booking site that allows you to list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

Tech stack:
* Python 3
* Flask
* SQLALchemy ORM
* PostgreSQL database
* Flask-Migrate for creating and running schema migrations
* HTML, CSS, and Javascript with Bootstrap 3 (provided by Udacity)

## [Project 2: API Development and Documentation](https://github.com/mahri-a/Full-Stack-Developer-Nanodegree/tree/main/02_trivia_api)

I was given a set of data models and the front end for a trivia game application. My task was to build a REST API in Flask to make the game functional, and to write its documentation. 

Tech stack:
* Python 3
* Flask
* SQLAlchemy ORM
* PostgreSQL database
* Flask-CORS to handle cross origin requests from the frontend server
* React-based frontend (provided by Udacity)
* unittest 
* curl

## [Project 3: Identity Access Management](https://github.com/mahri-a/Full-Stack-Developer-Nanodegree/tree/main/03_coffee_shop_full_stack)

I built the backend for a coffee shop application to allow users to login through Auth0 and, based on their roles and permissions, view drinks and recipes, create new drinks, and edit existing drinks. 

Tech stack:
* Python 3
* Flask
* SQLite database
* SQLAlchemy and Flask-SQLAlchemy
* jose (JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption) for encoding, decoding, and verifying JWTS
* Auth0 for authentication and defining roles and permissions
* Ionic-based frontend (provided by Udacity)
* Postman

## [Project 4: Deploying a Flask App to Kubernetes Using EKS](https://github.com/mahri-a/FSND-Deploy-Flask-App-to-Kubernetes-Using-EKS)

I created a container for a Flask web app using Docker and deployed the container to a Kubernetes cluster using Amazon EKS.

Tech stack:
* Docker
* AWS EKS & Kubernetes
* AWS Codebuild & CodePipeline

## [Project 5: Capstone](https://github.com/mahri-a/stellar-casting)

As my final project, I built an API for a hypothetical casting agency. It implements authorization with Auth0 and, based on their defined roles and permissions, lets users view, add, modify, delete movies/actors from the database, and assign actors to movies. 

Tech stack:
* Python 3
* Flask
* SQLALchemy ORM
* PostgreSQL database
* Auth0
* unittest
* curl
* Heroku
